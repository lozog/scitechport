This is a website that assists students at Port Credit Secondary School with their SciTech portfolios.
There are 2 login pages, one for students (the default) and one for teachers.
This site lets students create their portfolio (for the regional program for Port Credit Secondary School) all on the website, and lets teachers view the students' work and give it their signature.

Features:
- Sign up with your student number
- Dynamic list of all required items that updates as you complete items
- Upload images and other media
- Teachers can log in and view their students' progress/completed portfolios
